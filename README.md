# Krumo: PHP structured information display solution

![KRUMO - version 2.0 of print_r(); and var_dump();](http://krumo.kaloyan.info/images/logo.png)

Krumo is a debugging tool, which displays structured information about any PHP variable.
It is a nice replacement for `print_r()` or `var_dump()` which are used by a lot of PHP developers.

## Overview

To put it simply, Krumo is a replacement for `print_r()` and `var_dump()`. By definition Krumo
is a debugging tool, which displays structured information about any PHP variable.

A lot of developers use `print_r()` and `var_dump()` in the means of debugging
tools. Although they were intended to present human readable information about a
variable, we can all agree that in general they are not. Krumo is an
alternative: it does the same job, but it presents the information beautified
using CSS/JS/HTML.

## Installation

This library can be installed in autoloadable way using Composer as [kktsvetkov/krumo](https://packagist.org/packages/kktsvetkov/krumo).

```sh
php composer.phar require kktsvetkov/krumo
```

In the rare occasion that you are dealing with some legacy code that
has not yet embraced Composer, you can also download this package,
and include `class.krumo.php` in your project, or make it accessible
somewhere in your `INCLUDE_PATH`:

```php
include 'class.krumo.php';
```

More or less, that's it.

## Examples

Here's a basic example, which will return a report on the array variable passed
as argument to it:
```php
	krumo(array('a1'=> 'A1', 3, 'red'));
```

You can dump simultaneously more then one variable - here's another example:
```php
	krumo($_SERVER, $_REQUEST);
```
You probably saw from the examples above that some of the nodes are expandable,
so if you want to inspect the nested information, click on them and they will
expand; if you do not need that information shown simply click again on it to
collapse it. Here's an example to test this:
```php
	$x1->x2->x3->x4->x5->x6->x7->x8->x9 = 'X10';
	krumo($x1);
```
The krumo() is the only standalone function from the package, and this is
because basic dumps about variables (like `print_r()` or `var_dump()`) are the most
common tasks such functionality is used for. The rest of the functionality can
be called using static calls to the Krumo class. Here are several more examples:
```php
	// print a debug backgrace
 	krumo::backtrace();

	// print all the included(or required) files
	krumo::includes();

	// print all the included functions
	krumo::functions();

	// print all the declared classes
	krumo::classes();

	// print all the defined constants
	krumo::defines();
```
 ... and so on, etc.


Please note that the first time you call `Krumo` the dump it produces also
prints the CSS and the JS code used to expand/collapse the dump nodes.

### krumo::fetch()

If you want to get the output returned instead of printed, you can use
the `krumo::fetch()` method for that:
```php
	$a = krumo::fetch($app, $env);
```

### krumo::queue()

It's been a valid complain that sometimes Krumo output is called in the middle
of some opened HTML tag, and that breaks the output of both that tag and Krumo
itself. You can use `krumo::queue()` instead of `krumo::dump()` to solve that
problem, since `krumo::queue()` will print its output at the end of the script:
```php
	krumo::queue($request);
```

## Skins

There are several skins pre-installed with this package, but if you wish you can
create skins of your own. The skins are simply CSS files that are prepended to
the result that Krumo prints.

To the Krumo skin, you have to set it at `krumo::$skin`:
```php
	krumo::$skin = 'blue';
```

Here is a list of the pre-installed skins in Krumo

### skins/kaloyan.info

![skins/kaloyan.info](http://krumo.kaloyan.info/screenshots/krumo_kaloyan_info_theme.png)

	// set up using the "kaloyan.info" skin
	krumo::$skin = 'kaloyan.info';
```

### skins/default

![skins/default](http://krumo.kaloyan.info/screenshots/krumo_default_theme.png)

	krumo::$skin = 'default';
```
